# HisabDo-AI Email and Message Generator

## Final implementation report

### Summary

HisabDo-AI has an authenticated API for generating business emails and short
messages using the project's existing FastAPI, Pydantic, Gemini integration,
and business-context retrieval. During this task, the existing generator was
extended to accept explicit key points and additional communication purposes.
Existing routes and model configuration were reused; no email-sending
functionality was added.

### What was already in the project

- FastAPI application and bearer-token authentication in
  `AI_service/api.py`.
- Configured Gemini client and `ai_service.generate_answer` model adapter.
- Public business knowledge retrieval and user-scoped document/customer
  context retrieval.
- Communication request/response schemas, service, endpoint, and baseline
  automated tests.

The authenticated endpoint `POST /api/communications/generate` already
existed before the latest changes. The implementation in this task extends its
schema and prompt instead of adding a duplicate endpoint or AI service.

### Changes made in this task

1. Added `key_points` as an optional request field. It accepts up to 20
   nonblank items, each no longer than 500 characters.
2. Added `reminder`, `business_update`, and `meeting_confirmation` as supported
   purpose values.
3. Passed key points into both the existing public business-context search
   and the generation prompt. The prompt directs the model to include all
   supplied points without repetition.
4. Added API tests for key-point normalization and validation, purpose
   variants, and use of supplied key points in the prompt.
5. Updated usage documentation and this report.

### Files changed for this task

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `AI_service/schemas/communication.py` | Added key-point validation and communication purposes. |
| `AI_service/services/communication_service.py` | Uses key points for context retrieval and prompt instructions. |
| `AI_service/test_communication.py` | Added tests for new inputs and purpose options. |
| `README.md` | Updated supported options and request example. |
| `EMAIL_MESSAGE_GENERATION_REPORT.md` | Added this final implementation and verification report. |

`AI_service/api.py` already contained the authenticated endpoint and its
error-handling integration, so it did not need a task-specific change.

### Endpoint and request format

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/communications/generate`

**Authentication:** Required bearer token

**Request content type:** JSON

Example email request:

```json
{
  "communication_type": "email",
  "purpose": "follow_up",
  "tone": "professional",
  "length": "medium",
  "language": "English",
  "recipient_name": "John",
  "recipient_context": "We met to discuss expense tracking.",
  "key_points": [
    "Mention the offline-first records feature",
    "Ask whether John wants a product walkthrough"
  ],
  "additional_instructions": "Follow up about the previous meeting."
}
```

Successful email response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "content": {
    "subject": "Following Up on Our Previous Meeting",
    "body": "Hello John, ... "
  }
}
```

For `"communication_type": "message"`, `content` contains a single
`"message"` field instead of email subject/body fields.

### Supported inputs

| Field | Accepted values or limit | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `communication_type` | `email` or `message` | Required |
| `purpose` | `customer_support`, `follow_up`, `reminder`, `announcement`, `business_update`, `invitation`, `meeting_confirmation`, `custom` | `customer_support` |
| `custom_purpose` | Up to 300 characters; required only for `custom` | None |
| `tone` | `professional`, `formal`, `friendly`, `polite`, `persuasive`, `empathetic` | `professional` |
| `length` | `short`, `medium`, `long` | `medium` |
| `language` | Nonblank, up to 100 characters | `English` |
| `recipient_name` | Up to 120 characters | None |
| `recipient_context` | Up to 2,000 characters | None |
| `key_points` | Up to 20 nonblank items, 500 characters each | Empty list |
| `customer_identifier` | Up to 200 characters | None |
| `sender_name` | Up to 120 characters | None |
| `additional_instructions` | Up to 2,000 characters | None |

Unknown fields and unsupported option values are rejected by request
validation.

### Generation, context, and privacy behavior

- The service uses the existing configured Gemini model through
  `ai_service.generate_answer`.
- Relevant public business knowledge is retrieved using the request purpose,
  recipient context, instructions, and key points. Only entries explicitly
  marked public are passed to the model.
- Customer document excerpts are retrieved only when a customer identifier is
  supplied. Retrieval is scoped to the authenticated user's ready documents.
- Retrieved records are treated as information, not instructions. The prompt
  tells the model not to invent customer or business facts, policies, prices,
  dates, availability, commitments, or promises.
- Missing essential facts should be represented with a clear placeholder or
  a request for clarification. Email output is validated as subject and body;
  message output is validated as a message. The sender signature is requested
  only when a sender name was supplied.
- The endpoint generates content only; it does not send emails or messages.

### Error behavior

| Condition | HTTP response |
|---|---|
| Missing authentication | `401` |
| Invalid request values or field limits | `422` |
| Context/model service unavailable | `503` |
| Invalid or unparseable model response | `502` |
| Unexpected server processing error | `500` |

Provider details and invalid model output are not included in the public error
response.

### Verification results

#### Automated tests (mocked AI responses)

Command:

```powershell
python -m unittest AI_service.test_communication AI_service.test_business_summary AI_service.test_chat_api AI_service.test_customer_insights AI_service.test_rag_api -v
```

**Result: 76 tests passed.** The 11 communication tests cover email and
message output shapes, recipient and key-point handling, supported tones,
lengths, purposes and languages, defaults, required custom purpose,
validation limits, authentication, customer-record isolation, public-context
filtering, and provider/output errors. These automated tests mock the model
responses; they are not live-model tests.

#### Live Gemini smoke test

Two requests were also sent through the authenticated FastAPI endpoint to the
configured `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` model:

- An empathetic, short English follow-up email using synthetic recipient
  context and both supplied key points.
- A polite, short Spanish reminder message using synthetic recipient context.

Both requests returned **HTTP 200** with valid structured output. For this
smoke test, business-context retrieval returned an empty result; no customer
records or personal data were used. This confirms live endpoint/model
connectivity for those requests, but is not a broad quality or reliability
evaluation.

#### Static checks

- Pylance found no syntax errors in the edited schema, service, or test
  modules.
- Pylance diagnostics for the communication schema and service were empty.
- `git diff --check` completed without whitespace errors.

### Configuration and run commands

The implementation reuses these existing settings:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: required for live Gemini generation.
- `GEMINI_MODEL`: configured model name; the project default is
  `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`.
- `GEMINI_TIMEOUT_MS`: provider timeout in milliseconds; default is `30000`.
- `AUTH_SECRET`: configure a stable secret for deployed authentication.
- `DATABASE_PATH`: optional path for the SQLite database.

Install dependencies and run the API from the repository root:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-key"
$env:AUTH_SECRET = "a-long-random-secret"
$env:DATABASE_PATH = "data/assistant.db"
uvicorn AI_service.api:app --reload
```

Run the validated regression tests:

```powershell
python -m unittest AI_service.test_communication AI_service.test_business_summary AI_service.test_chat_api AI_service.test_customer_insights AI_service.test_rag_api -v
```

### Limitations and follow-up

- The live check covered two synthetic examples only. Review generated
  communications before sending.
- Prompt instructions and response validation lower the risk of unsupported
  claims but cannot guarantee that a language model will never hallucinate.
- Customer matching uses the existing document-chunk store and exact
  identifier matching; it is not a normalized customer/contact database.
- If public business-context retrieval fails, generation may continue without
  those retrieved facts.
- No screenshot was captured because verification used backend API requests
  through FastAPI `TestClient`, not a browser interface.
